I am a Junior Full Stack Developer, having recently graduated from Makers, a highly selective 16 week full-time bootcamp. Having built projects before Makers I am confident of my ability to now write scalable, efficient and well-tested code. I am looking for a role in which I can continue to learn and absorb new technologies, as well as working on great products.

## Makers Academy
Makers Academy is a highly selective, 16-week intensive development bootcamp. Throughout the course we learnt the values of DRYing our code and ensuring we followed SOLID principles. We also heavily relied on processes such as: test-driven code, Agile development, XP values and object-oriented design.

We worked extensively with both Ruby and Javascript and used frameworks such as Ruby On Rails and React. We also employed Rspec, Jasmine, Capybara, Cypress, Jest and Enzyme. By doing this it gave us the confidence to change our code without fear of breaking functionality without realising.

Throughout the course we had our code reviewed by our peers and coaches. The longer group projects gave us the opportunity to implement two day sprints that would consist of morning and afternoon stand-ups, code reviews alongside end of sprint retrospectives.

Over the course of Makers I worked on several group projects. The first was a clone of AirBnB, in which I was able to guide the non-javascript team through their first Node project. For the second project we implemented a facebook-esque app using Ruby On Rails. In my final group project, we chose to develop SentimentAlyzer, which collected streams of tweets of the top trending topics and then fed them into IBM Watsons natural language processing API, which was visualised with React graph components.
