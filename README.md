I am a Junior Full Stack Developer, having recently graduated from Makers, a highly selective 16 week full-time bootcamp. Having built projects before Makers I am confident of my ability to now write scalable, efficient and well-tested code. I am looking for a role in which I can continue to learn and absorb new technologies, as well as working on great products.
